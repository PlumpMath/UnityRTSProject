# Unity RTS Tech Demo Project Charter
## Purpose
The Unity RTS Technology Demonstrator project is a Real Time Strategy game that will be developed in several phases for the purpose of evaluation and learning game development tools geared for Indie developers. Unity 3D is the platform chosen for this project. Other tools may be brought onboard as needs are identified. The final result of this project will be a functional but limited RTS game.

## Scope
### Objectives
The project objectives are as follows: 

  1. Investigate the feasibility of a fully developed game project, and identify any areas of concern for such a future project.
  2. Gain familiarity with Unity and other Indie game development tools and identify any shortcomings that would need to be addressed for a future full-development effort.
  3. Create a walking skeleton that could serve as a basis for a future RTS full-development effort.
  4. Develop an RTS game in several phases with the finished project having all of the features identified in the Design Spec.
